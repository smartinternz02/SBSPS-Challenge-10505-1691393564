        <h2>Types of Charging Stations</h2>
        <p>There are several types of electric vehicle charging stations available to cater to different charging needs:</p>
        <p>Manual:
            The battery swapping station is a standalone device,
            in which batteries are placed and removed manually
            from the individual slots, usually by hand. Manual
            swapping stations are modular and occupy a minimal
            amount of space. These are used for 2W and 3W
            battery applications, as the battery pack sizes are smaller
            and the weight can be handled by one or two persons.</p>
        <p>
            Autonomous:
            A robotic arm is used in these types of swapping
            stations with the battery swapping process being
            semi/fully automated. Robotic swapping is used for
            4W and e-bus applications as battery packs are larger
            and heavier, and require mechanical assistance. These
            swapping stations are also more expensive and have a
            higher land requirement.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 1 Charging:</strong> This is the basic charging method that uses a standard household electrical outlet. It's suitable for overnight charging but relatively slow.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 2 Charging:</strong> A faster charging option, often found at public charging stations and residential installations. Requires a dedicated charging unit.</li>
            <li><strong>DC Fast Charging:</strong> Provides rapid charging at public stations, allowing significant charge within a short time. Commonly located along highways.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Benefits of EV Charging Stations</h2>
        <div class="container1">
            <ul >
                <li><strong>Lower Running Costs:</strong> The running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower than an equivalent petrol or diesel vehicle. Electric vehicles use electricity to charge their batteries instead of using fossil fuels like petrol or diesel. Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the electricity cost means that charging an electric vehicle is cheaper than filling petrol or diesel for your travel requirements. Using renewable energy sources can make the use of electric vehicles more eco-friendly. The electricity cost can be reduced further if charging is done with the help of renewable energy sources installed at home, such as solar panels.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Benefits:</strong> EVs produce fewer emissions, contributing to reduced air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Charging an EV is often cheaper than refueling a gasoline vehicle, leading to long-term cost savings.</li>
                <li><strong>Convenience:</strong> Home charging and increasing public charging infrastructure make owning an EV convenient for daily use.</li>
            </ul>
